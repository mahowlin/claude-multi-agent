# Skills

Skills define how agents behave. Copied to `.skills/` on `beehive --init`.

## Files

| File | Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `bee.md` | Bees | Execute plans, update status, report discoveries |
| `queen.md` | Queen | Create plans, track progress, verify completion |

## Customization

Edit `.skills/` in your project to customize behavior for that project only.
