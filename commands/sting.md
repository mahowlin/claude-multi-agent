# /sting - Self-Check

Sting yourself awake. Are you on track?

1. **Check your plan** - Re-read it. Are you following it?
2. **Check your status file** - Is `.hive/bee-N.md` up to date?
3. **Check your progress** - Have you checked off completed Tasks?

If you're actually done:

4. **Verify Done Criteria** - Is EACH one satisfied?
   - If NO: get back to work
   - If YES: continue

5. **Report discoveries** - Any out-of-scope work not yet reported?
   - If YES: run `/report` first

6. **Fill Completion Summary** in the plan:
   - **Achieved:** [what was done]
   - **Resume Notes:** [leave blank if complete]

7. **Update status file** - Set Status: Complete in `.hive/bee-N.md`

8. **Tell Queen:** "[plan] complete" with 1-sentence summary

**Do NOT edit TRACKER.md.**
